"""Helpers for the host-mount extension.

Host mounts are a Cube-specific extension to the E2B API: they are requested
through ``metadata["host-mount"]`` as a JSON-encoded list of descriptors, each
with ``hostPath`` / ``mountPath`` / ``readOnly``. CubeAPI lifts the value onto
the sandbox annotation of the same name; CubeMaster validates ``hostPath``
against the allowed-prefix whitelist (default ``/data/shared/``) and Cubelet
performs the bind-mount before the VM boots.
