features:
  - title: "⚡ Ultra-fast Startup"
    details: Resource pooling and snapshot cloning skip all cold-start overhead. Sandbox creation faster than a blink.
  - title: "🔒 Hardware Isolation"
    details: Every sandbox runs a dedicated OS kernel in its own MicroVM.
  - title: "🔌 E2B SDK Compatible"
    details: Compatible with E2B SDK interface. Switch from E2B Cloud seamlessly by changing one environment variable — zero client code changes.
  - title: "📦 High-density Deployment"
    details: MB-level per-sandbox overhead enables thousands of instances per server via kernel sharing and Copy-on-Write (CoW). Supports automatic sandbox pause and resume, further improving deployment density and cost optimization.
  - title: "🛡️ Network Security"
    details: eBPF-based inter-sandbox isolation and egress filtering at kernel level; built-in L7 security proxy enables per-domain/path/method policies with automatic credential injection — secrets never visible to sandbox code.
  - title: "📸 Flexible State Management"
    details: High-frequency snapshot and rollback at hundred-millisecond granularity. Create checkpoints on running sandboxes, roll back to any saved state at any time, or fork from a specific state to explore in parallel.
  - title: "💾 Volume Framework"
    details: E2B-compatible Volume framework that lets users plug in custom backend storage solutions. Volumes have an independent lifecycle and can be shared across sandboxes.
  - title: "🚀 Production Deployment"
    details: Deploy production clusters on Tencent Cloud with one click using Terraform. Also supports deployment on standard Kubernetes clusters (preview).
  - title: "💪 ARM Architecture Support"
    details: Full native ARM64 support across compilation, build, and deployment workflows.

## Get Started

- [Quick Start](./guide/quickstart.md) — from zero to a running sandbox in minutes
- [Self-Build Deployment](./guide/self-build-deploy.md) — build from source and deploy on a single machine
- [Multi-Node Cluster](./guide/multi-node-deploy.md) — scale to multiple nodes
- [Architecture Overview](./architecture/overview.md) — understand the system design and core components
