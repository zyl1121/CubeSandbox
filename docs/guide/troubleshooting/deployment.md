| `/data/cubelet` must be on XFS (reflink) | `cubelet` stores container writable layers under `/data/cubelet` and relies on XFS reflink. Deploying on ext4-rooted hosts (Ubuntu / Debian / WSL) makes the one-click pre-flight reject with `not XFS`. Workaround: mount a loopback `.img` formatted as XFS at `/data/cubelet`. For production, attach a dedicated XFS data disk (100–300 GiB). For fresh installs prefer OpenCloudOS 9 / RHEL family. | [#311](https://github.com/TencentCloud/CubeSandbox/issues/311), [#245](https://github.com/TencentCloud/CubeSandbox/issues/245) |
| Template Creation Times Out When the Sandbox CIDR Overlaps the LAN | The one-click deployment defaults the sandbox network to `192.168.0.0/18`. If the host LAN also uses `192.168.1.x`, Cube may allocate sandbox IPs that overlap the physical network, causing template creation or port probing to fail with `context deadline exceeded`. Change the Cubelet CIDR to a non-overlapping range and remove the old TAP devices plus `cube-dev` before restarting. | [Guide](./local-network-cidr-conflict.md) |
| Changing the CIDR (residual `cube-dev`) | Stopping Cube does not remove the `cube-dev` interface or `z*` TAP devices, so they linger after a stop. Changing `CUBE_SANDBOX_NETWORK_CIDR` to a range that overlaps the residual `cube-dev` is rejected by the pre-flight with a deterministic-reset hint (a reboot alone is not enough). A same-CIDR reinstall reuses `cube-dev` automatically. | [Guide](./local-network-cidr-conflict.md#changing-the-cidr-residual-cube-dev) |
| cgroup v2 `cpu` controller not enabled on Ubuntu, cubelet CPU quotas don't take effect | Ubuntu / Debian cloud images don't delegate the cgroup v2 `cpu` controller to child cgroups by default, and `multipathd`'s RT threads make `+cpu` writes fail with `Invalid argument`. See the issue for full repro and fix. | [#366](https://github.com/TencentCloud/CubeSandbox/issues/366) |
| bpffs is not mounted | `network-agent` pins its eBPF programs and maps under `/sys/fs/bpf`, so the installer stops before making system changes when that directory is not a `bpf` filesystem. | [Guide](#bpffs-is-not-mounted) |

## bpffs is not mounted

`network-agent` relies on `/sys/fs/bpf` being mounted as `bpffs` (bpf filesystem) to pin its eBPF programs and maps. In WSL2 or minimal Linux environments where `bpffs` is not mounted by default, the one-click pre-flight check rejects the deployment before making system changes.

### 1. Confirm Kernel Support

First, verify that the running kernel supports the `bpf` filesystem:

```bash
grep -w bpf /proc/filesystems
```

If this command produces no output, the running kernel lacks eBPF/bpffs support (missing `CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL`). Upgrade or switch to a kernel with eBPF support before retrying.

### 2. Mount bpffs

If kernel support is present, create the directory if needed and mount `bpffs` as root:

```bash
mkdir -p /sys/fs/bpf
mount -t bpf bpf /sys/fs/bpf
```

### 3. Make it Persistent (Optional)

To persist the mount across system reboots, add the following entry to `/etc/fstab`:

```text
bpf /sys/fs/bpf bpf defaults 0 0
```
